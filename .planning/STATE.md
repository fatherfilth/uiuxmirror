## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: TypeScript/Node runtime with Playwright for computed style access (pending validation)
- Phase 1: Hybrid inference engine (rules + Claude API) for component synthesis (pending validation)
- Phase 1: File-based JSON storage for v1 scope (pending validation)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Research validation needed before Phase 1:**
- CSS-in-JS library detection patterns (emotion, styled-components, Stitches) — each has different injection markers
- Playwright stealth configuration for anti-bot detection (Cloudflare, DataDome)
- Dynamic content wait strategies to prevent missing styles on framework-rendered sites
