# Phase 5: Export & Reporting - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-16
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Package extracted design DNA into human-readable reports and machine-readable export formats. Generate component stubs, multi-format token exports, and a comprehensive Brand DNA Report. CLI commands and MCP server integration are Phase 6.

## Implementation Decisions

### Export format priorities
- CSS custom properties is the primary format (lowest friction, works everywhere)
- All formats generated by default — no config needed to select formats
- Three export formats: CSS custom properties, Tailwind config, Figma tokens plugin format
- No additional formats beyond the three (SCSS, Style Dictionary, etc. not needed)
- Machine-readable JSON exports structured in two layers:
  - **Quick-lookup layer**: Direct token name → CSS value mappings for programmatic application
  - **Rich context layer**: Descriptions, evidence, relationships, and reasoning context for AI agents
- Agent-consumable export format is a priority — Claude agents are a primary consumer alongside developers

### Component stub format
- Stubs are **copy-paste starters** — working HTML/CSS you can drop into a project and build on
- Single-file format: one `.html` file per component with embedded `<style>` block (self-contained)
- All detected states included in one file (hover, focus, disabled, etc.) via CSS pseudo-classes and variant markup
- Stubs reference CSS custom properties (`var(--color-primary)`) — requires the CSS vars export alongside
- Stubs are not baked-in values; they connect to the token system

### Report structure & depth
- Primary audience: **Claude agents and developers** — structure for both AI and human consumption
- Token presentation: tables with values **plus usage examples** (code snippets showing application)
- Component catalog is **inline** within the main Brand DNA Report (not a separate document)
- Evidence citations are **inline** — each token/component shows source pages where it was observed
- Content style guide (voice/tone, CTA rules, error grammar) is a **separate document** (`content-style-guide.md`), not a section in the main report
- Report is Markdown format

### Claude's Discretion
- Report section ordering and heading structure
- Table formatting and column choices
- How to present interaction flow documentation
- Level of detail in usage examples
- Evidence citation formatting (parenthetical vs footnote-style)

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- JSON exports should have a quick-lookup layer (agent grabs a value) AND a rich layer (agent reasons about context) — two consumption modes
- Component stubs should feel like starter code, not read-only specs
- CSS custom properties as the foundation that stubs reference — everything connects through the token system
- Content style guide as its own deliverable signals it's a standalone reference, not buried in the report

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

- MCP server/tool for Claude agents to query and apply design DNA — Phase 6
- CLI commands for export invocation (`uidna export`) — Phase 6

</deferred>
